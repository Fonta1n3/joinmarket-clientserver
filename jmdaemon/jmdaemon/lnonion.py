### MESSAGE FORMAT USED on the LN-ONION CHANNELS

( || means concatenation for strings, here)

Messages conveyed between directly connected nodes with `sendcustommsg`
have the format described here:

https://lightning.readthedocs.io/PLUGINS.html#custommsg

Note in particular, that `type` is a two byte hex-encoded string
that prepends the actual message (also hex-encoded), without any intervening
length field. This `type` is the integer specified in this file as *_MESSAGE_TYPES.

Note also that the type *must* be odd for custom messages (the "it's OK to be odd" principle).

In text, the messages we send via this mechanism are of this format:

from-nick || COMMAND_PREFIX || to-nick || COMMAND_PREFIX || cmd || " " || innermessage

(COMMAND_PREFIX defined in this package's protocol.py)

Here `innermessage` may be a list of messages (e.g. the multiple offer case) separated by COMMAND PREFIX.

Note that this syntax will still be as was described here:

https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/JoinMarket-Docs/blob/master/Joinmarket-messaging-protocol.md#joinmarket-messaging-protocol

Note also that there is no chunking requirement applied here, based on the assumption that we have a sufficient 1300 byte limit.
That'll probably be changed later.

### CONTROL MESSAGES

#### HANDSHAKE CONTROL MESSAGES

The message `handshake` is sent by any peer/node not configured to act as
directory node, to any other node it connects to, as the first message.
The message `dn-handshake` is sent by any peer/node which is configured to
act as a directory node, to any other node, as a response to the initial
`handshake` message.
(Notice that this configuration implies that directory nodes do not currently
talk to each other).

The syntax of `handshake` is:
json serialized:
  {"app-name": "joinmarket",
   "directory": false,
   "proto-ver": 5,
   "features": {}
  }
Note that `proto-ver` is the version specified as `JM_VERSION` in jmdaemon.protocol.
(It has not changed for many years, it only specifies the syntax of the messages).
The `features` field is currently empty.

The syntax of `dn-handshake` is:
json serialized:
 {"app-name": "joinmarket",
  "directory": true,
  "proto-ver-min": 5,
  "proto-ver-max": 5,
  "features": {}
  "accepted": true,
 }

 Non-directory nodes should send `handshake` to directory nodes,
 and directory nodes should return the `dn-handshake` method with `true`
 for accepted, if and only if:
 * the protocol version is in the accepted range
 * the `directory` field of the peer is false
 * the `app-name` is joinmarket
 * the set of features requested is both recognized and accepted (currently: none)

 In case those conditions are met, return `"accepted": true`, else return
 `"accepted": false` and immediately disconnect the new peer.
 (in this rejection case, the remaining fields of the `dn-handshake` message do
 not matter, but can be kept as before for convenience).

In case of a direct connection between peers (neither are directory nodes),
the party which connects then sends the first `handshake` message, and the
connected-to party responds with their own `handshake`.

In this case, the connection should be accepted and maintained by the receiver
if and only if:
* the protocol version is identical
* the `directory` field of the peer is false
* the `app-name` is joinmarket
* the set of features is both recognized and accepted (currently: none)

otherwise the peer should be immediately disconnected.

ALL OTHER MESSAGES (control or otherwise, as detailed below), cannot be sent/
will be ignored until the above two-way handshake is complete.

#### OTHER CONTROL MESSAGES

The messages `getpeerlist` and `peerlist` are special messages sent to and
from directory servers.

The syntax of `getpeerlist` is:

from-nick || NICK_PEERLOCATOR_SEPARATOR || peer-location

`from_nick` must be a valid Joinmarket nick belonging to the sending node.
The `peer-location` field can either be a 66 character hex-encoded pubkey or a full peer location
as `pubkey@host:port`.

This message is crucial to the network function, since only from here does the directory node know
the match between the nick (which is cryptographically signed in Joinmarket across channels) and the
LN node pubkey. Notice that more than one nick is NOT allowed per LN node; this is deferred to
future updates.

The syntax of `peerlist` is:

nick || NICK_PEERLOCATOR_SEPARATOR || peer-location || "," ... (repeated)

i.e. a serialization of two-element tuples, each of which is a Joinmarket nick followed by a peer
location, as for the `getpeerlist` message.

#### LOCAL CONTROL MESSAGES

There are two messages passed inside the plugin, to Joinmarketd, in response to events in lightningd,
namely the `connect` and `disconnect` events triggered at the LN level. These are used to update
the *state* of existing peers that we have recorded as connected at some point, to ourselves.

The mechanisms here are loosely synchronizing a database of JM peers, with obviously the directory
node(s) acting as a queryable resource. It's notable that there are no guarantees of accuracy or
synchrony here.

PARSING OF RECEIVED JM_MESSAGES
===

The text will be utf-encoded before being hexlified, and therefore the following actions are needed of the receiver:

Extract rawtlv field which is received as encoded json:

json.loads(msg.decode("utf-8"))["unknown_fields"][0]["value"]

(the ["number"] key is used to check for control messages, see below for details).

Then: unhexlify, converting to binary, then .decode("utf-8") again, converting to a string.

Split the string by COMMAND PREFIX and parse as `from nick, to nick, command, message(s)`.

These arguments can be passed into Joinmarket's normal message channel processing, and should be
identical to that coming from IRC.

However, before doing so, we need to identify "public messages" versus private, which does not
have as natural a meaning here as it does on IRC; we impose it by using a to-nick value of PUBLIC
and by sending the message type `687` to the lightning plugin `jmcl.py` instead of the default
message type `685` for privmsgs to a single counterparty. This will instruct the directory server
to send the message to every peer it knows about.
